PizarraDeLucasHTML5
===================

Lucas' Whiteboard is an application especially designed for young children to enjoy and learn colors.

It is very easy to use because it only has a very intuitive screen.

The child may use one or more fingers at once to draw.

Each time you select a color this is heard and so the child learns.

This is the HTML5 version of the Android app Pizarra de Lucas, that you can find at:
